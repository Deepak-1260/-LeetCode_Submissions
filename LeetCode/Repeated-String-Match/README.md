# Repeated String Match

Can you solve this real interview question? Repeated String Match - Given two strings a and b, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string a so that string b is a substring of it. If it is impossible for b to be a substring of a after repeating it, return -1.

Notice: string "abc" repeated 0 times is "", repeated 1 time is "abc" and repeated 2 times is "abcabc".

 

Example 1:


Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.


Example 2:


Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
Output: 2
